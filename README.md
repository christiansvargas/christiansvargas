# Student Seeking Software Engineering Internship | CS @ GMU

Hi, my name is **Christian**, and I'm working towards a bachelor’s degree in computer science. I've been programming for six years through courses taught at my high school, where the main focus was Java, and through university coursework. I’ve strengthened my software development skills through various projects. Overall, I enjoy any area that is technical in nature, and the fields of computer programming and math attest to that enjoyment. I also love communicating my ideas to others and hearing different perspectives regarding computer science.

## Skills and Technologies
- **Languages**: Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, R
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, OpenAI API, Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), React, Node.js, Swing
- **Developer Tools**: Git, GitHub, Unix/Linux, AWS Lambda, Visual Studio Code
- **Security**: SHA-256, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- **Other**: 3D Printing, Computer-Aided Design (CAD)

## Past Projects

### **Spotify Music Recommendation System**
- Built a Python-based music recommendation engine using machine learning techniques such as content-based
filtering and cosine similarity to suggest songs from each user’s favorites.
- Optimized for scalability and responsiveness, implementing a model that can efficiently generate recommendations
for large datasets in real time.
- Documented using a README file that details project setup, usage instructions and methodology and clear inline
comments to explain code logic.
- Practiced version control utilizing a well-structured GitHub repository, ensuring ease of collaboration,
reproducibility and future scalability.
- **GitHub**: [github.com/christiansvargas/recommendation-system](https://github.com/christiansvargas/recommendation-system)

### **Hackathon Project: Apollo AI**
- **Award**: 1st place in the ”Most Likely to Become a Startup” category at PatriotHacks
- On a 4-person team, built an end-to-end platform that integrates Azure OpenAI GPT-4o mini with Amazon Alexa
for intelligent responses and accessible document summarization.
- Prototyped a 3D-printed Echo Dot casing in CAD; engineered AI prompt/response flows; implemented Git-based
change management; integrated the Alexa Skill Management API with the OpenAI API.
- **Devpost/GitHub**: [devpost.com/software/apollo-ai](https://devpost.com/software/apollo-ai-eqvxh3)

### **IB CS Internal Assessment: Password Manager**
- Built a desktop application that safely stores passwords to solve a client’s problem of having to remember various
login credentials, following the software development life cycle.
- Satisfied the client’s security requirements by hashing and encrypting their login information using SHA-256 and
AES; leveraged the Swing graphical user interface library to create a user-friendly experience; automated the
opening of the browser for simple password entry.
- Earned a score of 6 out of 7 on the internal assessment, leading to an overall IB score of 5 out of 7 in IB Computer
Science HL, which evaluated to 6 college credits.
